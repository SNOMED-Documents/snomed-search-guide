# Appendix C- An Example Search and Data Entry Overview Table

This section presents an example of a table, which is currently under development, intended to provide an overview of the various search techniques presented in this document, and their applications.

## Search by Term Text â€“ Overview Table

Table assumptions:

* Search terms are at least 3 characters (what about phrases like 'of' or very short terms like "mg" or "MI")
* Filters should be applied
* Case sensitivity
* Search term preparation (and maybe SNOMED CT term preparation)

Ordering and presentation have not been considered.
