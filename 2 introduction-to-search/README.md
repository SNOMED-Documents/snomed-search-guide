# Introduction to Search

Search is the process by which a user finds a Concept or Description to represent a clinical idea for a specific purpose.

The way a search is carried out depends on the setting in which it is performed. A simple search may involve typing a word or phrase in a search box, getting a list of matching terms and viewing the list to identify the appropriate Concept. This Guide considers a range of enhancements to SNOMED CT searches which can make it quicker and easier for users to find the appropriate Concept.
