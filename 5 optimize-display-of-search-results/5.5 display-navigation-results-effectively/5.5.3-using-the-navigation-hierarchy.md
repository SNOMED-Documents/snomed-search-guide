# Using the Navigation Hierarchy

_SNOMED CT subtype Relationships_ provide a logical semantic _hierarchy_. Often it is possible to view parts of the terminology and select particular _Concepts_ by navigating through this _subtype hierarchy_. However, there are many situations in which the pure _subtype hierarchy_ does not provide an ideal route for navigating the _hierarchy_ (see [Using the Subtype Hierarchy](5.5.1-using-the-subtype-hierarchy.md)).

Navigation hierarchies can be used to drive some types of structured data entry. Navigation hierarchies can order data in sensible ways by priority, or by some readily understood convention (e.g. "cranial nerve order" or "pharmacy products in the order of strength"). Navigation hierarchies can be used for diverse purposes (e.g. "topics related to diabetes").

_Navigation links_ are used to provide an alternative route through parts of the terminology. A _navigation link_ can link any two _Concepts_ together to identify a useful route for _navigation_. Each of the _navigation links_ is directional, linking a navigational parent _Concept_ to a more refined navigational _child Concept_. However, unlike the _subtype relationship_ the presence or absence of a _navigation link_ neither adds to nor subtracts from the definition of either of the _Concepts_ that it links.

Some _Concepts_ may exist only to provide nodes in a _navigation hierarchy_. These _Concepts_ are _subtypes_ of | Navigational _Concept_ _|_ and play no part in the semantic definitions of any other _Concept_.

Navigational hierarchies are represented as Reference Sets, which are available in the International Release of SNOMED CT or they can be created from scratch to meet specific user needs. Navigational hierarchies created from scratch do not have to represent subtypes or logical relationships unless it is required.
