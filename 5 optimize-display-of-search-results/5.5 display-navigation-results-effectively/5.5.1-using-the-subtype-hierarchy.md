# 5.5.1. Using the Subtype Hierarchy

The most visible hierarchical construct in SNOMED CT is the subtype hierarchy. This is constructed using a set of logical rules.

The primary use of the SNOMED CT subtype hierarchy is to support effective retrieval and aggregation of data. 

## Example:

The Concept "Laparoscopic emergency appendectomy" can be reliably located by subtype navigation from any of its supertypes: "appendectomy," "laparoscopic appendectomy" or "emergency appendectomy." 

# Enhanced Hierarchical Displays

It is possible to start at the top of hierarchy and navigate from parent to child in order to find a Concept or term in SNOMED CT. A more efficient approach, however, is to use the hierarchy to supplement a keyword search by enabling the user to look at related Concepts in order to consider them as alternative matches, or to check the context of a search result. The following examples illustrate these two uses of the SNOMED CT hierarchy. 

## Examples:

### 1\. Checking supertypes:

A user wishes to find a _Description_ that relates to the condition of a patient who is hypersensitive to an allergen. The user performs a search on the _keyword_ "Hypersensitivity" and finds an exact match. Before the user selects the _Description_ for inclusion in the patient record, they check the _Fully Specified Name_ , which is | Sensitivity (finding) |. The user then checks the _hierarchy_ and discovers that the selected _Concept_ has | Psychological finding | as an _ancestor_ , which indicates that this is not the correct _Description_ to use in this context. 

### 2\. Checking subtypes:

A user wishes to find a _Description_ that relates to the condition of a patient who is hypersensitive to an allergen. The user searches for the _keyword_ "allergy," and finds one _Concept_ having a _Description_ that is an exact match. The user then looks at the _children_ of the _Concept_ (i.e. those _Concepts_ immediately below it in the _hierarchy_). One of the _children_ has the preferred _Description_ | Contact Hypersensitivity | which matches the user's intended meaning. The user selects this _Concept_ for inclusion in the patient record.
