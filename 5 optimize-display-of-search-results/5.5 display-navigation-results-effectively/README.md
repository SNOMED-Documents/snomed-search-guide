# Display Navigation Results Effectively

Results navigation is a useful feature for search browsers to have in addition to the conventional display of search results (see [Order Search Results Rationally](../../5-optimize-display-of-search-results/5.1-order-search-results-rationally.md) and [Rationalize Search Results by Subsumption Checking](../5.4-rationalize-search-results-by-subsumption-checking.md)). The decision to design navigation results in a browser may depend on space availability in the application's user interface. This sub-section describes two different types of hierarchies for browsing search results.
