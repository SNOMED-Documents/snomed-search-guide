Results navigation is useful feature for search browsers to have in addition to the conventional display of search results (see [5.1. Order Search Results Rationally](5.1.-Order-Search-Results-Rationally_33490641.html) and [5.4. Rationalize Search Results by Subsumption Checking](5.4.-Rationalize-Search-Results-by-Subsumption-Checking_33490663.html)). The decision to design navigation results in browser may depend on space availability in the application's user interface. This sub-section describes two different types of hierarchies for browsing search results.
