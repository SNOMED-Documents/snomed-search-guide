# 5.1.6. Alphabetical Ordering

As noted in [5.1.1](5.1.1.-Order-Shortest-Matching-Terms-First_33490642.html), alphabetical ordering of search results should **NOT** be used for general purpose searches of SNOMED CT. Instead the shortest matches, best matches or most commonly used matches should be shown first. However, there may be some specific situations in which it may be useful to alphabetically order a short list of matches. For example short pick-lists may be alphabetically ordered in a data entry form. [see Examples of applied mechanisms of structured data entry]
