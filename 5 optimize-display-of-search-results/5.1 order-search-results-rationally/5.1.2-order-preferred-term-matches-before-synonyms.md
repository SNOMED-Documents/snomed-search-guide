# 5.1.2. Order Preferred Term Matches Before Synonyms

It is recommended to order preferred term matches before synonyms, particularly in clinical settings, as the _Preferred Term_ is a common word or phrase used by clinicians to name that _Concept_. This technique will enhance usability and significantly increase the speed of data entry. It may be helpful to the user whether the candidate match is a Preferred Term or synonym.
