# 5.1.5. Display the the Most Frequently Used Descriptions Listed First

This option will require the application to track the frequency of term selection so that search results can show the most frequently selected terms near the top of the results or displayed separately in the results. If this technique is chosen, user guidance may be necessary to minimize the risk of overusing the frequently used Descriptions as they would be easier to find. An alternative way of browsing through frequently used terms is to give the user the option to store the frequently selected terms as personal favorites and recall with user-defined abbreviated access [term](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCRELFMT/term+\(field\) "Reference term: term \(field\)") following a search. [see Use Mnemonics and personal favorites for data entry]
