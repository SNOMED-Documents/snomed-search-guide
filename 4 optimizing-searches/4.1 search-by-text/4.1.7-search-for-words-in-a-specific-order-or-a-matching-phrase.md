# 4.1.7. Search for Words in a Specific Order or a Matching Phrase

This technique enables the user to find Descriptions that matches all words in the search text. This means that the order of terms in the Concept or Description should be in the exact same order as the terms fully or partially represented in the search text. It may be useful to have this option user configurable and not have it configured as a default option.
