# 4.1.6. Search for Identical Terms

This technique enables exact matches to be found in the search result instantly regardless of the interposing words; otherwise, search on a single word may produce many matches. This technique should be used in scenarios where the wording of the desired description is known to the user who wants to search for and instantly select from the search candidates without having to scroll through a long list of search results. It may be useful to have this option user configurable and not have it configured as a default option as it may overly constrain the search leading to missing candidates.
