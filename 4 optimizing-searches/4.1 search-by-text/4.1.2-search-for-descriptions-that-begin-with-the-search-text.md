# 4.1.2. Search for Descriptions that Begin with the Search Text

This technique enables the user to find Concepts and Descriptions that begin with the text string entered in the search box. This search potentially reduces the number of keystrokes required to enter the search string. This technique is also used in scenarios where the user needs to find Concepts where they know the start of the description, but not the entire description. It is maybe, for many uses cases, a very useful technique to be configured as a pre-selected option that is user configurable.
