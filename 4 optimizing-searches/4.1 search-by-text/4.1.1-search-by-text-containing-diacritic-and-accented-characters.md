# 4.1.1. Search by Text Containing Diacritic and Accented Characters

Diacritic and accented characters should be properly retrieved and displayed to ensure the completeness of a search. For instance, Sjögren must also be found by 'sjogren' and Ménière by 'meniere'). This example is specific for searches in English or in languages that do not use special characters. In countries, such as Swedish and Danish, that use special characters, it would be wrong to return "Sjögren" when searching from "Sjogren".
