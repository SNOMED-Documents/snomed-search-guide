# 4.1.4. Search for Descriptions that End with the Search Text

This technique enables the user to find Concept and Descriptions that end with word ending(s) entered in the search box. This is not considered to be a very useful technique for many use cases, nevertheless, there may be scenarios where the user may want to search for the required text at the end of words. E.g. drugs ending in "statin" â€“ finds Atorvastatin, Cerivastatin, Fluvastatin. It may be useful to have this option user configurable and configured as a default option.
