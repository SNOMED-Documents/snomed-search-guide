# 4.5.3. Allow Slow Searches to Be Paused or Cancelled

When a search is slow to find any matches, it may be useful to give the user the option to pause or cancel the search. This technique would benefit applications or scenarios which either require:

  * Less frequent data entry;
  * Searching a large SNOMED CT subset;
  * A lot of processing power, which could potentially impact search performance or the overall system performance, or
  * Access to a terminology server via an Application Programming Interface (API).
