# 4.5.4. Enable Background Encoding

Techniques that support real-time searches \[see [4.5.1 Enable real time searching](4.5.1-enable-real-time-searching.md)] and qualifier resolution \[see [4.3.2 Extend search by postcoordinated searching](<../4.3 extended-searches/4.3.2-extend-search-by-postcoordinated-searching.md>)] may also be extended to enable background encoding of complete sentences as they are entered. This method can be applied to text entered by typing or by voice recognition.

As text is entered, the search mechanism attempts to narrow the selection. If there are multiple possible matches, then these are presented to the user for selection. If there is a single match, the encoding is accepted by default; otherwise the user can override the match by selecting an alternative Concept or Description. A single good match is found at the end of the process, thereby encoding the text in the sentence.

There are many possible variants on this technique. For example, as the possible matches are narrowed down, the system could offer an auto-completion option similar to that used in web browsers and word-processors.
