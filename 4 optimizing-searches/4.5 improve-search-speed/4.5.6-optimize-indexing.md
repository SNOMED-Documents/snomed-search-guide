# 4.5.6. Optimize Indexing

Indexing SNOMED CT content facilitates fast and accurate text searches. Search functionality queries the indexed content (by keyword) to return a list of search candidates matching the query. General purpose index features may be sufficient for enabling rapid SNOMED CT searches. However, developers and users should be aware that search tools may need to be configured for SNOMED CT searches due to different stop word indexes and to ensure effective searches of the types described in this guide.

See [Appendix A - Using Search Index Files](Appendix-A---Using-Search-Index-Files_33490714.html) for further information.
