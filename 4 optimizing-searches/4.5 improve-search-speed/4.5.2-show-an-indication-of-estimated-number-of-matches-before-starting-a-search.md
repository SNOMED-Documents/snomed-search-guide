# 4.5.2. Show an Indication of Estimated Number of Matches Before Starting a Search

One possible solution to show the number of search results is an interface that performs real-time checking of the number of search results while the user is typing. The interface may indicate this to the user, allowing them to decide when to stop typing and commence the search. A further enhancement is to automatically return the list of matches whenever the user stops typing, or when the number of matches is reduced to an acceptable level.
