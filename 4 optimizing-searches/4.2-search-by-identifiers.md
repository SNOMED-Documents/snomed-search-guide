# 4.2. Search by Identifiers

Searching by SNOMED CT identifier either as a Concept Identifier or a Description Identifier is useful in scenarios where the user knows the SNOMED CT Concept or Description they require.

It is useful in use cases for browsers, but is not an appropriate way to search in clinical applications. As a general rule the default behavior of clinical application should not display identifiers and users should never be expected to remember, type or cut-and-paste identifiers for data entry.
