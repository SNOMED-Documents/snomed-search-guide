# 6.1.4. Effective and Consistent Data Entry

SNOMED CT can support consistent data entry. The unique Concept Identifiers support unambiguous representation of the clinical content applied in Clinical Information Systems.

However, the flexibility of SNOMED CT allows entering expressions in various ways which may hamper consistency and retrieval. Structured data entry mechanisms such as, having a pre-defined set of Concepts for a specific clinical data entry field in a form can constrain the number of Concepts visible to documenting clinicians and enhance consistent use of SNOMED CT Concepts. [see Examples of applied mechanisms of structured data entry]

Therefore it is important that each SNOMED CT-implementation includes strategies for how to balance the flexibility of SNOMED CT when entering data into the clinical record.
