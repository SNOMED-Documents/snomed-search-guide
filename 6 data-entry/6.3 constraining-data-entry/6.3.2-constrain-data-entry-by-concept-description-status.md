# 6.3.2. Constrain Data Entry by Concept Description Status

Constraining data entry by Concept Status and Description Status should be done in order to avoid recording Concepts and Descriptions which for some reason have been inactivated. Inactive Concepts or Descriptions have been assessed to be unsuitable for recording. Therefore they should not be included as a possible result of a search, which would make them candidates for clinical recording.
