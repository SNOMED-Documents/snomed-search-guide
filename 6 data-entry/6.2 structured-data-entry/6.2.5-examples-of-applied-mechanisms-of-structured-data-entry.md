# Binding a Concept to a Data Control Used for Entering a Numeric or Other Value

When a value is entered in this control it is labeled with the appropriate Concept Identifier and added to the record.

# Association of a Concept with Particular Options Presented by a Check Box, Option Button or Other Data Entry Control

When selections are made using this control the appropriate Concept identifier is added to the record. 

# Binding Concept to a Particular Combination of Values or the Result of a Computation Involving Several Items of Previously Entered Data

When specific values are entered the appropriate (defined) Concept identifier is added to the record. The above examples show how specific numeric values can lead to specific clinical findings, based on pre-defined rules. 

The example at the bottom of Figure 39, illustrate that the BMI can be automatically calculated by the entered values for body weight and height. Moreover, it is possible to develop rule-based coding (i.e. algorithms that assign BMI values between 20 and 24 to the SNOMED CT Concept 35425004 | normal body mass index |, or to a more specific Concept 412768003 | body mass index 20-24 - normal |.

Value| Concept  
---|---  
< 20| 

  * 6497000 | decreased body mass index |
  * 427090001 | body mass index less than 16.5 |
  * 310252000 | body mass index less than 20 |

  
25 <| 

  * 48499001 | increased body mass index |
  * 162863004 | body mass index 25-29 - overweight |
  * 162864005 | body mass index 30+ - obesity |
  * 408512008 | body mass index 40+ - severely obese |
